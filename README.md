# Purpose
This program is a Chess Engine with a pygame-based GUI.
It contains several pre-made player types such as
"Random", "Human", and "AI"

The AI player uses a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
for move selection.

# Quick start
Download all files. 
Ensure they are contained in the same folder.  
Make sure you have python 3 and pygame installed!
```console
python3 main.py
```

# Directions
Click to move pieces.
Available spots for each piece will be highlighted when clicked.

"r" resets the game.

"c" changes your color and resets the game.

Player types can be changed in main.py.

New player types can be added to Player.py.
